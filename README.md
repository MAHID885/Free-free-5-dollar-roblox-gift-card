# Free-free-5-dollar-roblox-gift-card
Create a Roblox gift card generator that simulates the generation of valid gift card codes. The generator should provide a realistic output for each code generated, taking into account the standard formatting and length of Roblox gift card codes. It should also include an option to specify the amount of Robux for the gift card. Ensure that the generated codes are fictional and not usable for actual transactions. Include a disclaimer stating that these codes are for entertainment purposes only.
